## What have been used until now:

* HTML

* CSS

* Vanilla JavaScript (ECMA Script 6)


## I've been using this patterns to make a clean code structure:

* BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

* Sass (With .scss)

* JsPrettier

* Babel (to add ECMAScript6 support to older browsers :D)


## how it works? It's simple! Follow the instructions bellow:

First of all, you need to clone this repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/gabriel-brito/itelios-frontend-challenge.git
``` 

And then you install a local server and the dependencies inside the project with:

```
cd itelios-frontend-challenge
npm i
npm install http-server -g
```

Up the server with:

```
http-server

Now you can access by your browser with your on location!

Ex: 192.168.0.86:8080
```

And now you can access the project on your localhost!<br>
Simple, not?

## Notes:

* I used Babel transpiler to give support to older browsers.

* I didn't used any framework or JavaScript library :) 

* Layout followed the same layout as the image layout!

* Media Querie support since 991px

* bad news: I coudn't make an carousel :c
